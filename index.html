      </audio>
               <p>This is one of my first beats when I first started
               to get at beat making im still no where done when
               it comes to leaning beat making. This is only a sample
               of it because I like to keep the full verison to myself
               or in case someone wants it.</p>

    <div class="stuff" id="second">
      <audio controls>
       <source src="My second Beat.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      </audio>
                <p>This is my second beat that I have been working on
                this one is when I started to mess a lot more when It
                came to sampling music I did pretty well for a guy who
                isn't that good with beat making yet lol. I hope you
                enjoy the 4 beats I post on this website so far.</p>

    <div class="stuff" id="third">
      <audio controls>
       <source src="My Third Beat.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      </audio>
               <p>This beat I took inspiration from lil uzi
               I  wanted to see if I could make a beat that I
               think he would rap on and it came out pretty
               good opinion. it os kind of short because like
               I said in my first beat I did not want to post
               the full beat.</p>
    </div>
   <div class="stuff" id="fourth">
      <audio controls>
       <source src="My fourth Beat.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
      </audio>
              <p>This is my fourth and last beat that I posted on
              this website I made this beat with a friend this is
              really the first time I made a beat with anyone because
              I believe that my other beats were no where as good as they
              are now. I did a lot of research in my spare time to learn
              how to do some of this.</p>
