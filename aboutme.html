      <h2>My hopes and dreams for the future</h2>
      <p>Hello my name is Eric White well most of you already
         knows me but for the people who Don't here is a brief
         paragraph about me. My dream is to become a music producer
         I have a passion for music. Music is a great thing to have
         it helps you out in many different ways from helping you
         let out enough emotions when you need to, so i want to be able
         to help produce music that will help bring joy to people or to
         help them with their problems. Music is a great outlet for When
         you just need to let loose or help inspire you in anyway. Music
         also runs in my blood I have family memebers that played in bands
         and other places so its natural to have this type of passion in my
         view.</p>

     <h2>Part 2 of my hopes and dreams</h2>
     <p>The reason why I picked this major is because
       this is the only major that will help me achieve my dreams
       of becoming a music producer. Yes I know that this Major
       is not 100% for music but it teachers you a lot on how techology
       is shows and booth at plays work, you may think will how is that going
       to help you? well the stuff that I have learned far does actually because
       I am learning how to work the techology I can one day use that knowlegde
       to set a studio. Coding also comes into play because as a music producer
       your client might want you to make a website with lyrics for him or her
       and coding helps teach you how to make your instruments without actually
       using a real life instruments.So this is the end of my read me page thank
       you.</p>
